    "text": "Bayesian Alternative to the Duckworth-Lewis Method\n\nIn rain-affected T20 cricket matches, estimating target scores fairly and accurately is a difficult challenge. The Duckworth-Lewis (DL) method addresses this by estimating a batting team’s remaining resources using 2 variables: overs left and wickets lost. However, the DL method suffers from key limitations like a non-monotonic resource table and a lack of adaptability to modern gameplay. In this project, we propose The Trident, a Bayesian model that generates an improved, data-driven resource table that better replicates the changing strategies during T20 matches. Leveraging a dataset of roughly 10,000 professional T20 innings from Cricsheet, we constructed a smoothed, monotonic estimate of scoring potential using Stan-based Bayesian inference. Our model captures more realistic game dynamics by explicitly modeling 3 separate innings phases (powerplay, middle overs, and death overs) and accounts for a monotone structure in its resource table. Using RMSE ratios between The Trident and the DL method, empirical results show that The Trident outperforms the DL, especially during the powerplay and middle overs. These improvements highlight the promise of Bayesian modeling for addressing shortcomings in the DL method.\n\n\nBayesian Approach to Duckworth-Lewis"

I analyzed the accuracy and the pros and cons of each method used.\n\n\nForecasting Scores in T20 Cricket Games"
